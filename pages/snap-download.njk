            <h2>What do you do when the truth is raw? You speak it anyway.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25em; margin: 2% 0 3% 0;">What made The Snap Download different was its dedication to being provacative and contrarian.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 1%;"><strong>Company Profile</strong></h3>
            <p>The Snap Download was a commentary e-zine based out of Arizona. The goal of an article for The Snap Download--a "Snap Download" as we called it--was to be unapologetically loud. Our motto was "Irreverence, Brevity, Contrarian Thinking." It didn't matter if it was political commentary, sports commentary, or even a music review--irreverence was king. </p>    
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 1%;"><strong>Weekly Columns</strong></h3>  
            <p>The greatest challenge in writing a "Snap Download" was weaving a narrative that was simultaneously irreverent AND heartfelt. It was never explicity stated, but I never wanted the irreverence to BE the column. I considered that hacky, and if your reader hasn't learned something or isn't pondering a question from your article on their ride to work, you didn't do you job.</p>
            <p>In 2015 I ended up accidentally writing the most-read article on the website after angering affiliate columnist Cal Thomas when I (well to be honest, when I was very rude to him in an article I wrote) responded to a silly article he had written about climate change.</p>
